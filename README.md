DistributeLinklist-plowshare
============================

Distribute links in one list, each to one computer in an other list, to download it via plowshare.

This is convenient, if you do not have a premium account and can not reconnect to get a new IP but have multiple PCs (and thus different IPs).

As Captchas are not solvable with distributed plowshare due to it's imagemagick implementation, this script is configured to use denoyse/JCaptchaSolver-plowshare. Nevertheless, it would also work well with a Captcha solving service.
